# Project Overview



Rotating a 2D matrix is a common operation in computer science and programming.
The term usually refers to the transformation of a matrix by swapping its elements
based on a specific pattern to achieve a rotation effect. Here's a general overview of rotating a 2D matrix in Python:

**Overview of Rotating a 2D Matrix:**

**1. Matrix Rotation Basics:**
   - A 2D matrix can be visualized as a grid of elements arranged in rows and columns.
   - Rotating a matrix typically involves swapping its elements based on a specific pattern.

**2. Rotation Patterns:**
   - There are different rotation patterns depending on the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the number of rotations (90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, etc.).

**3. Clockwise Rotation:**
   - To rotate a matrix clockwise, each element at matrix[i][j] is moved to matrix[j][n-i-1], where n is the size of the matrix.

**4. Counterclockwise Rotation:**
   - To rotate counterclockwise, each element at matrix[i][j] is moved to matrix[m-j-1][i], where m is the number of rows in the matrix.

**5. Implementation Steps:**
   - Determine the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns).
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each element of the matrix.
   - Swap elements based on the specified rotation pattern.

**Example Code for Clockwise Rotation:**

```python
def rotate_clockwise(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        for j in range(i, n - i - 1):
            temp = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[n - j - 1][i]
            matrix[n - j - 1][i] = matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1]
            matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1] = matrix[j][n - i - 1]
            matrix[j][n - i - 1] = temp

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate_clockwise(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

**Example Code for Counterclockwise Rotation:**

```python
def rotate_counterclockwise(matrix):
    m = len(matrix)
    for i in range(m // 2):
        for j in range(i, m - i - 1):
            temp = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][m - i - 1]
            matrix[j][m - i - 1] = matrix[m - i - 1][m - j - 1]
            matrix[m - i - 1][m - j - 1] = matrix[m - j - 1][i]
            matrix[m - j - 1][i] = temp

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate_counterclockwise(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

These functions modify the input matrix in place. The actual rotation logic involves swapping elements, and the loops ensure that all elements are appropriately rotated. The example matrices are 3x3, but the approach is generalizable to matrices of different sizes.
