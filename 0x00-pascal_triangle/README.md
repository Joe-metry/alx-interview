Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern of numbers that has many interesting properties. In Python, you can generate Pascal's Triangle using a simple loop or recursion. Here's a brief overview of how to generate Pascal's Triangle in Python using a loop:

```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = [1]  # The first element in each row is always 1
        if triangle:
            last_row = triangle[-1]
            row.extend([last_row[j] + last_row[j + 1] for j in range(len(last_row) - 1)])
            row.append(1)  # The last element in each row is always 1
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle

# Generate and print Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows
pascals_triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(5)
for row in pascals_triangle:
    print(row)
```

In this code:

- `generate_pascals_triangle` generates Pascal's Triangle up to the `n`th row.
- Each row starts with a `1`.
- For rows other than the first row, it calculates the values between the first and last element by summing the two elements directly above in the previous row.
- Each row ends with a `1`.
- The resulting triangle is stored in a list of lists (`triangle`), where each inner list represents a row.

You can adjust the `n` parameter to generate Pascal's Triangle with the desired number of rows. The code above will print Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows as an example.
