**Overview:**

This Python method aims to find the fewest number of operations required to generate a specific number of "H" characters in a text file using only two operations: Copy All and Paste. This problem is commonly referred to as "2 Keys Keyboard" and is often used to illustrate dynamic programming concepts.

**Method:**

The `minOperations(n)` method calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly `n` "H" characters in the file.

**Input:**
- `n`: An integer representing the desired number of "H" characters.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the fewest number of operations required to achieve `n` "H" characters.
- If achieving `n` is impossible, it returns 0.

**Example:**

Consider the example where `n = 9`. The method proceeds as follows:

1. Start with a single "H."
2. Copy All ("H" is in the clipboard).
3. Paste ("HH" in the file).
4. Paste ("HHH" in the file).
5. Copy All ("HHH" is in the clipboard).
6. Paste ("HHHHH" in the file).
7. Paste ("HHHHHHHHH" in the file).

In this example, the fewest number of operations required to obtain 9 "H" characters is 6.

**Usage:**

```python
result = minOperations(9)  # Returns 6
```

**Notes:**

This problem demonstrates the importance of dynamic programming, as it efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required to reach the desired result, making it a useful tool for various scenarios involving repetitive tasks or resource allocation.
